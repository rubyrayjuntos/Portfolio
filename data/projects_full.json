From generative art to AI-assisted writing, the boundaries between human and machine creativity are becoming increasingly blurred.\n\n## The Collaborative Potential\n\nRather than viewing AI as a replacement for human creativity, I believe we're entering an era of unprecedented collaboration. AI can handle the technical aspects of creation, allowing humans to focus on the conceptual and emotional elements that make art truly meaningful.",
